# delphi-kml
A little experiment with reading KML (Keyhole Markup Language) files in Delphi, as well as writing them to binary form for faster loading.

The experiment is based on the free KML file of the Dutch postal code map (PC4), as offered by Indra:

which is not included in the repository.

Mind, this is not a generic, full fledged KML loader and viewer!
